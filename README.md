# John Doty - Full Stack Developer
This portfolio was put together with React.js, styled-components, react-router, and react-spring. Using the fetch API, I made a call to a backend made with Node.js and Express. This returns data that is used to populate the projects section.

## Challenges
- It was difficult to make the router work with animations. The main issue was the mobile menu styling interfering with the styling needed for the transitions.
- The react-spring library was a hard library to get used to. In particular, I had a hard time choosing between all the hooks.

## Future Improvements
- UI/UX - I would like to make things more mobile friendly by adding navigation closer to the bottom of the screen for users on phones.
- Animation - It seems to be creating a memory leak. I plan to look for ways to create great animations without too much processing.
